# MatrixMathWizard

Matrix Operations is a C++ program that allows users to perform basic operations on matrices. The program is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and provides functionalities to create matrices with random or user-specified dimensions, set elements randomly or by user input, display matrices, perform matrix addition, and generate identity matrices.

Features
Create a matrix with random dimensions and values.
Create a matrix with specific dimensions and input values from the user.
Display the elements of a matrix.
Perform matrix addition with another matrix.
Generate an identity matrix of a specified size.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this program, you will need:

C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.
CMake (optional, if you prefer to build using CMake).
Build and Run
Clone the repository or download the source code.

Compile the program using the C++ compiler:

bash
Copy code
g++ main.cpp Matrix.cpp -o MatrixOperations
If you prefer using CMake, you can create a CMakeLists.txt file and build the project using CMake.

Run the executable:

bash
Copy code
./MatrixOperations
Usage
Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu to choose the operations.

To create a matrix with random dimensions and values, choose option 1.

To create a matrix with specific dimensions and user input values, choose option 2.

To display the elements of a matrix, choose option 3.

To perform matrix addition with another matrix, choose option 4. Note that the matrices must have the same dimensions for addition.

To generate an identity matrix of a specified size, choose option 5. Note that identity matrices are square matrices with diagonal elements as 1 and others as 0.

To exit the program, choose option 6.
