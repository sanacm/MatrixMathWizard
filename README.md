# MatrixMathWizard

Matrix Operations is a C++ program that allows users to perform basic operations on matrices. The program is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It provides functionalities to create matrices with random or user-specified dimensions, set elements randomly or by user input, display matrices, perform matrix addition, and generate identity matrices.
Features
Create a matrix with random dimensions and values.
Create a matrix with specific dimensions and input values from the user.
Display the elements of a matrix.
Perform matrix addition with another matrix.
Generate an identity matrix of a specified size.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this program, you will need:
C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.
CMake (optional, if you prefer to build using CMake).
Build and Run
Clone the repository or download the source code.
Compile the program using the C++ compiler:
bashCopy code
g++ main.cpp Matrix. cpp -o MatrixOperations
If you prefer using CMake, you can create a CMakeLists.txt file and build the project using CMake.
Run the executable:
bashCopy code
./MatrixOperations
Usage
After running the program, you will have a menu to choose the operations.
To create a matrix with random dimensions and values, select option 1.
To create a matrix with specific dimensions and user input values, choose option 2.
To display the elements of a matrix, select option 3.
To perform matrix addition with another matrix, choose option 4. Note that the matrices must have the exact dimensions for addition.
To generate an identity matrix of a specified size, select option 5. Note that identity matrices are square with diagonal elements as 1 and others as 0.
To exit the program, choose option 6.
